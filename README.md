# Concrete2Cabinetry
Concrete-2-Cabinetry is the official repo for the construction company "Concrete 2 Cabinetry" based out of Albany, NY.  I started the project in order to help boost the company's business and online presence in the region.

**Demo link to the project:** colemodelo.github.io/concrete2cabinetry

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript

This site is built off of the Telephasic template created by HTML5 UP - Design Templates. I did some serious changes though and modified a solid portion template in order to meet the client's demands. One of the biggest areas of change to site was to the landing page. I made some major changes to the navbar and added a custom graphic of the Concrete2Cabinetry logo. Some other changes to the template included adding a carousel image gallery, vertical quote/testimonial slideshow, and a new "Contact Us" form.

<!--Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!-->

## Lessons Learned:

One of the biggest mistakes I made on this project was the template selection. In hindsight, I should have selected a different template or built the site from scratch. The template I used, while great, is much better suited for a personal portfolio site, not a small construction comapny. At first, I had thought that modifying this template would be an easy task but it turned out to be much more tedious than expected. <br>
Another lesson learned was that image carousels can be created using only HTML and CSS; however, JS definitely is a friend here.

<!--No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.-->
